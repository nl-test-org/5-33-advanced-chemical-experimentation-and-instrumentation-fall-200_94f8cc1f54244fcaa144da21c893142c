description: This appendix describes the use of Gaussian 98W software for calculating
  vibrational frequencies for the isotopomers of acetylene. We will use Gaussian 98
  to perform Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations that solve the full molecular
  Hamiltonian for acetylene and from the computed potential energy surface derive
  the normal mode vibrational frequencies. These will be compared with your experimental
  values.
